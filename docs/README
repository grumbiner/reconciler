  The script build_mask.sh will carry out all the makes and executables needed
to build a mask file in Hycom .a, .b format.  The file paveout contains the
bathymetry as a C-unformatted floating point array (in fortran order) and the 
mask as a C-unformatted unsigned character array (in fortran order).

  To run on a grid of your choice, you must re-link your grid.b file to 
fort.61, and your grid.a to fort.061a.  Once this is done, you should be
able to execute the programs without difficulty.

  Flag values are:
 0  coast (from paving)
 1  boundary
 3  undefined
 5  land
15  ocean
16  final_ocean (from paving)
17  water (non-ocean)

Notes:
  The finer the resolution coastline file you use, the longer it takes to
run the program.

  If the coastline file is too coarse, some of the coastline polygons 
do not close in grid space and will leak land (or lake) over a large area.
For the 1/3rd degree hycom grid, 4 km coastline is needed (at 85 North
1/3rd degree longitude is about 3.2 km).

  For paver: if the grid is specified as degrees east only, then the 
straits file must also have degrees east.  Ex: The strait of Gibraltar 
at 5.6 W needs to be listed at 354.4 E if the grid is specified as the 
standard hycom 1/3rd grid, longitudes from 260-ish to 380-ish east.  
Same rule for specifying the central ocean point to fill from.
