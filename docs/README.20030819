 
  The reconciler is packed as either individual tar files, or with everything
in a single file -- reconciler.all.tar.

  The individual files are:
reconciler.only.tar -- the reconciler-specific codes, scripts, and makefile
mmab.include.tar    -- the MMAB C++ class library, required by the reconciler
ncep_third.tar      -- demonstration grid files for the 1/3rd NCEP grid
demo.tar            -- sample output from a run on the ncep_third grid
shorelines.tar      -- GMT coastline files
etopo2.tar          -- ETOPO2 data files

  Shorelines is approximately 88 Mb, and etopo2 is approximately 114.  The
rest totals less than 20 Mb.

  Unpack in to your desired locations and then see the README included in
the reconciler directory.
